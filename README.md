# Exploring Graph Methods for Stock Forecasting

For the longest of time LSTMs and transformers have been the industry standard for time series analysis and anything that involves data as a series.
This project is trying to expand the horizon for time series analysis by employing graph theory for stock forecasting.

## How is graph helpful?

Graph is a mathematical data structure that exists in a non-euclidean space meaning its orientation does not matter.
This begs the question than how will it help in time series where the data is a sequence and the importance of orientation is paramount.

**The Visibility Graph** is what enables graphs to be used for time series analysis. Visibility Graph in action.
